This app uses the new Google Cloud Messaging API.

You will need to update your SENDER_ID in GCMService with one that you can get from Google Cloud Dashboard for your project.  
Also you will need to provide address to your server where the app can register itself.

It works with my example server which can be found in [here](https://github.com/gregttn/GCMPlayServer)
